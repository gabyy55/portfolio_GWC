<p style="color:Peru;"class="double">Since I started getting into coding, i've done work on a website called Scratch. On that website I started making games like paddle ball or side scrollers. While working on that website i've started practicing how to make MVP's, storyboards, and wireframes. Below are two of the games that I have made.</p>


<p5 style="color:Burlywood;"> Paddle ball game:</p5> 
<style>
p.double {border-style: double;}
</style>
<p style="color:Peru;"class="double">This was the first game I created on scratch with a partner, and together we were able to get the paddles and ball to move so two players can play the game.We also added extra features, like sound and color change. </p>

<p style="color:Peru;"class="double">So far, my experience has been good with robotics. We started working with an Arduino and a mini robot. Since starting, we have worked and been successful in creating a circuit, programing a code and having it conncect to the LED's, and making the piezo speaker from the Arduino make a song, and have the robot "dance" to the song that it's playing. </p>
